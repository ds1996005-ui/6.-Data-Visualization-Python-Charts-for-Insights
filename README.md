# 6.-Data-Visualization-Python-Charts-for-Insights
Helps us to learn and understand how to visualize and interpret data trends and patterns using Python charts.
1.Load cleaned dataset into pandas and verify column names and datatypes, because visualization
accuracy depends on correct structure.
2.Create a basic bar chart of top 10 categories/products based on total sales or revenue and label axes
clearly.
3.Create a line chart for time-series trends like sales over months, ensuring dates are sorted and
grouped properly.
4.Create a histogram for numeric distributions like profit/ratings, so outliers and skewness are visible.
5.Create a scatter plot to show correlation between two variables such as revenue vs profit, or GDP vs
happiness score.
6.Add titles, legends, gridlines, and appropriate figure sizes to improve readability like professional
reporting visuals.
7.Highlight key insight points such as peaks in time series or highest bars to show storytelling through
charts.
8.Write 3 insights under graphs inside notebook, focusing on interpretation not just plotting.
9.Export notebook as PDF/HTML or take snapshots of graphs for submission
